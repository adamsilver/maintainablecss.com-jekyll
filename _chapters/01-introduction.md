description: An introduction to MaintainableCSS, an approach to writing modular, scalable and of course maintainable CSS.
---

MaintainableCSS is an approach to writing modular, scalable and maintainable CSS. Not only does this guide explain *how* to do this, but more importantly it explains *why*.

## There's nothing to download

This is not a library or framework. It's a set of principles, guides and conventions to help you write CSS for small or large-scale websites.

## What does maintainable mean?

Maintainable CSS can be defined as being able to make styling changes, without worrying about accidentally causing problems elsewhere.

## What does scalable mean?

Scalable CSS means that as CSS increases in size, it's still easy to maintain. If you've ever inherited a large CSS codebase, and been afraid to make changes, you'll sympathise with this.

## What does modular mean?

A module is a distinct, independent unit that can be combined with other modules to form a more complex structure. In a living room, we can consider the TV, the sofa and the wall art to be modules, all coming together to create a room.

If we take one of the units away, the others still work. We don't need the TV to be able to sit on the sofa etc. In a website the header, registration form, shopping basket, article, product list, navigation and homepage promo can all be considered to be modules.

## Is this for you?

If you've ever experienced pain when writing or maintaining CSS, then you'll find useful information in this book. And if you work in a team, this book can serve as documentation.

## Is this hard to learn?

No. You can read this in under 20 minutes which includes the rationale behind the approach. Implementing it takes less than a minute.
