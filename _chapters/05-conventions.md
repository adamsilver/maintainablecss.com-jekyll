description: Learn the simple conventions that MaintainableCSS employs to write modules, components and state.
---

*MaintainableCSS* has the following convention:

	.<module>[-<component>][-<state>] {}

Square brackets are optional depending on the module in question. Here are some examples:

	/* Module container */
	.searchResults {}

	/* Component */
	.searchResults-heading {}

	/* State */
	.searchResults-isLoading {}

Notes:

- component and state are both delimited by a dash
- names are written with lowerCamelCase
- selectors are prefixed with the module name

## Must I give a class name to every element?

No. You can write `.searchResults p` if you want to. And sometimes you may have to, if for example you're using markdown. But beware that if you nest a module which contains a `p` it will inherit the styles and need overriding.

Also, remember that it is hard to find if/where styles are used or not if you're creating css selectors as the one defined above, which is not good for maintainability.

However, it seems righteous to only give class name to elements that are actually styled.

## Why must I prefix the module name?

Good question. Here's some HTML without a prefix:

	<div class="basket">
	  <div class="heading">

And the CSS:

	/* module */
	.basket {}

	/* heading component of basket module */
	.basket .heading {}

There are two problems:

1. when viewing HTML, it's hard to differentiate between a module and a component; and
2. the `.basket .heading` component will inherit styles from the `.heading` module which has unintended side effects.
